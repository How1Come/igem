      <p>Our team aims to produce two different types of engineered proteins to target lung cancer cells and check for whether two groups of peptides have any synergic effects with doxorubicin. </p>
      <p>Lung cancer was the commonest cancer in Hong Kong. It accounted for 15.5% of new cancer cases in 2021 in Hong Kong. Galectin is a common receptor of lung cancer cell. </p>
      <p>We used AI-algorithm to generate peptide sequences by targeting galectin receptor on lung cancer cell membrane.  </p>
      <p>Moreover, 4 peptides from Cordyceps militaris, a well‚Äêknown dietary therapy in anticancer treatment, have been selected to test their effectiveness to lung cancer. </p>
      <p>Then, those peptides have been expressed by BL21. Finally, A549, a lung cancer cell line, has been used to test the effectiveness of those peptides and check for whether two groups of peptides have any synergic effects with doxorubicin, a common chemotherapy medication used to treat cancer.</p>
      <p>If there are synergic effects, lower concentration of doxorubicin can be used, so that it can reduce the side effects of it. </p>

		Customarily, the iGEM competition focuses on scientific research, however, the focal point of our project is to use synthetic biology as a medium to improve people's living standards. Our team has launched an education scheme as a way of introducing our project to the people around us. While it is known that lung cancer is the most common type of cancer in Hong Kong, only few are aware that synthetic biology can be used to treat cancer. Through our comprehensive education scheme, we have reached out to different people, including those with special needs, to introduce them to our project through our tailor-made activities and publications. The knowledge levels in the education scheme were carefully adjusted to ensure that people from all age groups were able to understand the scientific concepts clearly. On top of promoting science, positive values were heavily emphasized when preparing and conducting educational activities. We hope to serve the target groups from our heart and keep our programmes human-oriented and meaningful alongside promoting science. Consequently, accomplishing effective science communication from scientists to the general public and building the sense of belonging to the community for citizens.

        <h3><b>DNA Extraction from Fruits</b></h3>
      </li>
      <p>
        Participants of our activities may have heard of the word 'DNA' but they may not really know what the secret behind these 3 characters are. By extracting DNA from fruits, DNA is visualized without using any microscopic equipment. 
        This activity offers a hands-on exploration of genetics by guiding participants through the process of extracting DNA from bananas. Each participant is provided with a fresh banana, enclosed in a zipping bag, and is tasked with mashing the banana into a smooth paste. This paste is then mixed with a solution containing water, soap, and dishwasher detergent, which helps to break down the cell membranes and release the DNA from the banana cells. The mixture is subsequently filtered to clarify the solution. Cold alcohol is added to the filtered mixture. This step precipitates the DNA, causing it to separate from the rest of the cellular components. Participants are then able to observe the DNA as a white, foamy substance, providing them a tangible and visual understanding of the extraction process.

        <h3><b>Twinkle Twinkle Little Jar</b></h3>
      </li>
      <p>
        We hope to equip participants with the skills of using a micropipette, which is a common apparatus used in laboratories. Through this experience, we are hoping to inspire the interests of participants in synthetic biology and experimental knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this engaging activity, participants are invited to create their own miniature works of art by transferring dyed water into small plastic containers using micropipettes carefully. After filling the containers with a spectrum of hues, they are instructed to change the tips of their micropipettes and add a layer of oil to the water. This creates a mesmerizing, layered effect within the jars. To add a final touch of sparkle and creativity, glitter and dry flowers are sprinkled into the containers, allowing participants to personalize their creations. Each "Twinkle Twinkle Little Jar" becomes a unique, shimmering testament to the participant's artistic expression and precision.

        <h3><b>DNA Handmade Fans</b></h3>
      </li>
      <p>
        Kindergarten students were guided to draw two S-shaped lines on the paper fan to represent the double helix shape of DNA. Next, they chose four colors to represent the nitrogenous bases A, T, C, and G respectively, and drew the bases between the lines, ensuring that they follow the rules of complementary base pairing. Through creating their own representations, students gained a better understanding of the structure of DNA and what it looked like.

      <br>
      <p>
        Participants joining the primary school and special community workshops were presented with a set of artistic iron wires and a plain paper hand fan to craft a unique souvenir that represents the structure of DNA. The iron wires came in four distinct colors, each symbolizing one of the four nucleotide bases of DNA: Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Cytosine (C), and Guanine (G). A black /blue color was designated as the sugar phosphate backbone of the DNA molecule. Using these materials, participants were encouraged to weave and shape the wires onto the paper fan, mimicking the double helix structure of DNA. This activity not only served as a creative outlet but also reinforced their understanding of DNA's composition and structure. The DNA handmade fans, adorned with the intricate wire designs, were then taken home by participants as a memorable souvenir.

	<h1 class="animate__animated"id="edu-3">2. Publication </h1>
	<p>
		To ensure that the knowledge level of our publications are suitable for readers in different age groups, we have written three versions of promotional materials, including the kindergarten leaflet, primary level booklet and secondary level pamphlet.
		<br>
    
    <h2>Kindergarten</h2>
		<p>
      Our team created a two-page leaflet which aimed at educating kindergarten students about basic knowledge of DNA. We hope to arouse children’s interest in synthetic biology by educating them about the basic knowledge of biology. In turn, inspiring kindergarten students to become biologists in the future.
    </p>

		<br> 
		<br>
    
    <h2>Primary schools</h2>
    <p>
      Books about biology in public libraries are often unsuitable for primary students to read. They are either picture books which are too easy, or reference books whose target readers are adults. Therefore, in order to equip children with basic knowledge of biology, materials tailor-made for primary school students are needed. We decided to make a booklet which is concise that suits the relatively short attention span of children. 
    </p>

      <br>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>In order to reach a wider audience, we specially designed a captivating picture book for kindergarten students. It is rare for kindergarten students to learn about the characteristics of DNA and the issue of lung cancer—our team's chosen topic of research. </li><br>
        <li>Our team seized this opportunity to spread the awareness of lung cancer and provide kindergarten students with a brief introduction to DNA and the innovative usage of biotechnology. To make the complicated ideas more understandable for kindergarten students, we simplified the concepts of lung cancer and the structure of DNA.</li><br>
        <li>To ensure our picture book is eye-catching and interesting, we created a fantasy story in which a Prince and a Princess are the main characters. The Princess is suffering from lung cancer, so the determined Prince decides to find Anticancer Peptides (ACPs) and treat the Princess. To make the illustrations visually appealing, we used soft, dreamy colors and illustrated with smooth lines. We included dialogues with plain wording with a bilingual format for the students to understand easily and learn English. The book is 16 pages in length, which is suitable for kindergarten students.</li><br>
        <li>The picture book has been distributed to kindergartens all over Hong Kong.</li>

        <li>
          Our team visited Hong Kong (Ascot) Preschool & Playschool to conduct some educational activities.<br><br>
          An interactive drama about lung cancer was designed for kindergarten children. The characters include a Prince and a lung cancer cell, both portrayed by our students. The cartoon face mask and bodysuit of the lung cancer cell were perfectly suited for young kindergarten students.<br><br>
          The story started when the Prince was attacked by the cancer cell. The children had to complete three tasks to obtain the medicine needed to save him. This storyline is easy for kindergarteners to understand, while conveying the message that lung cancer is a significant disease.<br><br>
          Through this drama, kindergarten students could learn more about biotechnology, such as the basic concepts of DNA. Additionally, the continuous laughter of the children during the performance reflected the drama's success.<br><br>

    <br>
    <li> Other activities on 10/7 </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        After the drama, the children were required to complete three tasks to obtain the ‘medicine’ to save the Prince.
        <ul>
          <li>First task — **ATCG Puzzle**</li>
          <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5056/wiki/wiki-images/education/k3.jpg" width="600"/>
          <br><br>
          <p>
            Before the “ATCG Puzzle” game, we first introduced the concept of DNA to kindergarten students, which is a fundamental element of biotechnology. We explained the function and structure of DNA, as well as the rules for complementary base pairing.
            In the activity, students first searched for small ATCG puzzle pieces hidden in various corners in the classroom. They then assembled these pieces to complete a DNA double helix strand. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5056/wiki/wiki-images/education/k4.jpg" width="600"/>
          <br><br>
          <p>
            The success of completing the puzzle demonstrated that the students had a clear understanding of the concept of complementary base pairing through game.
          </p>
          <li>Second task — **ATCG Lining Up**</li>
          <br>
          <p>
            After the students had grasped the basic knowledge of complementary base pairing through the puzzle activity, we encouraged them to pair up  in the game “ATCG Lining Up.” In this game, each student received an ID card labeled with one of the four bases: A, T, C, or G. The students lined up according to the ATCG sequence provided on the question sheet.
          </p>
          <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5056/wiki/wiki-images/education/k5.jpg" width="600"/>
          <br><br>
          <p>
            The success in forming the correct lineup not only demonstrated their understanding of the concept of complementary base pairing from the puzzle activity but also reinforced their comprehension through active participation.
          </p>
          <li>Third task — **DNA Fan** (mentioned above)</li>
          <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5056/wiki/wiki-images/education/k6.jpg" width="600"/>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>
        After completing all three tasks, students received a sticker resembling the medicine that they could stick on our student portraying the lung cancer cell. This illustrated the lung cancer cell was killed.<br><br>
        This interactive element allowed the children to actively “attack” the lung cancer cell and rescued the prince. This part concludes our kindergarten activity.<br><br>
        It was a rewarding experience for our team members as they might not have had chances to encounter such young kids in their daily life. Our team members conducted the activities with patience and care. The children were cute and loving that our team members were very excited to meet the much younger version of themselves. <br><br>
        After the activities, the children were asked to fill in a feedback form by colouring the smiley faces, which indicated their satisfaction. The overall rating was high, scoring an overall average of 5.7/7.<br><br>

	<h2>Morning assembly in LMC</h2>
	<p>
		The morning assembly was designed for students from form 3 to form 6, considering that senior form students have a deeper understanding of science compared to junior form students. We hope that students can understand more about synthetic biology and our project conceptually.
	Form 4 students attended the morning assembly in the covered playground,while forms 3, 5 and 6 students watched the assembly on a live stream.</p>
	<div class="row mt-4">

		</div>
	</div>

	<br>
	<p>During the 15-minute-assembly, we covered various topics to raise awareness and engage the students. We began by introducing the basic information about black soldier flies, highlighting their significance. We also discussed the current issues of bacterial infections and plastic pollution, emphasizing the importance of finding sustainable solutions. Furthermore, we introduced the application of synthetic biology in our project, showcasing how this field of study can contribute to addressing the challenges we discussed earlier. Lastly, we presented our project and encouraged the students to participate by filling out our survey, as their responses are important to our research. </p>
	<img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4794/wiki/education/education-58.jpg" height="400"/>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>To make the assembly more entertaining, we incorporated a series of dialogues to introduce our project. Additionally, we injected humour into the presentation, such as sharing a joke about the weight of plastic consumed by Hong Kong people each day being equivalent to 38,850 times the weight of one of our teammates. This lighthearted approach effectively captured the students' attention while providing them with a relatable comparison to comprehend the scale of waste.</p>

		</div>
	</div>
	<br>
	<p>Moreover, in order to make the concepts more accessible to students, we utilized visual aids such as models to illustrate abstract concepts. For example, we used plastic pipes to symbolize the plasmid of E. coil and the gene of black soldier fly. We coated the pipes with coloured tape to represent different genes. These visual aids helped to simplify complex ideas and make them more understandable for the students. </p>

	<h2>Food Waste collection booth during lunchtime in CPU</h2>
	<p>
		In February 2023, a food waste up-cycling booth was set up during lunchtime in our school. Various types of food were collected and supplied to black soldier fly larvae. Students and teachers were found curious about black soldier flies and their properties. We discovered that the teacher and students were not scared to touch the black soldier flies. Therefore, we knew that black soldier fly could be a good solution to reduce food waste since people were not afraid of it. The food waste collected in the canteen rubbish bin was greatly reduced and most of the food waste was digested in 2 days.</p>

	<h2>Growing black soldier fly in HCY:</h2>
	<p>
		We have integrated a practical component into our educational efforts by nurturing and growing black soldier flies right within our school premises. This hands-on experience not only aligns with the core principles of iGEM but also provides a unique learning opportunity for students. They can witness firsthand the life cycle of these flies and understand the ecological significance of our project.</p>

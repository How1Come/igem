lead %}In the iGEM Competition, we celebrate student effort and achievement. The
Attributions form helps the judges differentiate between what students
accomplished from how their external collaborators supported them. Therefore,
teams must clearly explain on the standard Project Attributions form what work
they have conducted by themselves and what has been done by others.{% endblock

        AIS-China 2024 is formed by a group of motivated, aspirational, and
        enthusiastic high school students. While being all high school students,
        the members of AIS-China has demonstrated courage, professionalism,
        independence, and the pursuit for perfection. We cheered for successes
        in our weekly exchange conferences, and we cried together for failures
        in experiments, yet we never gave up. Being all high school students, we
        have stunned college students multiple times, and we continue to do so.
        This year, AIS-China chose to diminish mosquitoes, the most annoying and
        meanwhile the deadliest insect worldwide. We keep track of tasks and
        personal contributions within the team, and document them down in sheets
        with caution and impartiality. We also appreciate every individual not
        in the team contributing to our project development. We also keep track
        of these contributions and carefully express our appreciation, yet with
        sincere gratitude.
